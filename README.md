# ostle_flutter

Ostle built in [Flutter](https://flutter.io) with [SpriteWidget](https://github.com/spritewidget/spritewidget).

All rights of Ostle (オストル) belongs to [Miyabi Games](https://twitter.com/miyabigames),
this project is just a coding practice to implement the game rule.
Please purchase the original version to support the creator.

To understand the game rule, it's good to start from the printable [trial version](http://gamemarket.jp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ostle_free_trial_version_Normal.pdf).

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Save/restore configurations and game states with persistent storage
